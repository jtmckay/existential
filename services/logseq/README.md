Show stopper that was resolved: there's a difference between typing enter, and hitting the carriage return on mobile (AKA constant format issues). Updating the config.edn resolved this issue.

`config.edn`

```
:shortcuts {
  :editor/new-block "enter"
  :editor/new-line "shift+enter"
}
;; Optionally, set this too:
:shortcut/doc-mode-enter-for-new-block? true
```
