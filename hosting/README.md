#### Container management

- [Docker](./docker/README.md)
- [Portainer](./portainer/README.md)

#### External network (access remotely)

- VPN is the most secure option (skip caddy/cloudflare)

## Existential script

`./existential.sh`

1. Find top-level .env.example file
2. Create .env from .env.example (if .env doesn't exist)
3. Interactively replace EXIST_CLI placeholders in .env
4. Automatically replace other EXIST\_\* placeholders in .env
5. Source .env to load variables into shell environment
6. Find and create service-level .env files (depth 2)
7. Interactively replace EXIST_CLI in service .env files
8. Automatically replace EXIST\_\* in service .env files
9. Generate docker-compose.yml from enabled services
10. Report completion summary and thank you

### Enable/disable services

After running `./existential.sh`, there should be a `.env` file at the root of the repository, there are environment variables for each service. Set the services you want to run to `true` and the ones you are not running on the machine to `false`. When you enable/disable services you must regenerate the docker-compose.yml using `./existential.sh` to reflect the enabled services. The script will not replace an existing docker-compose.yml, but instead will create a docker-compose.generated.yml that you can copy over the docker-compose.yml if desired. It also generates a `diff` file to help you find the changes, if you want to keep the majority of your existing docker-compose.yml file.

## Supplemental

1. .env.example

A comprehensive environment configuration file with:

- Global settings (enabled services, Docker network, logging)
- Default values for common settings
- EXIST_CLI is the value for env variables, the `./existential.sh` script will prompt for a value
- EXIST_24_CHAR_PASSWORD will generate a 24 character password for the corresponding .env file
- EXIST_32_CHAR_HEX_KEY will generate a 32 character hex for the corresponding .env file
- EXIST_64_CHAR_HEX_KEY will generate a 64 character hex for the corresponding .env file
- EXIST*DEFAULT* values will be used to populate any service .env.example variables

2. docker-compose.yml

A master orchestration file that:

- Uses Docker profiles to control which services deploy
- Implements shared logging and environment configurations
- Properly defines service dependencies and health checks
- Uses NFS volumes for persistent data (via TrueNAS)
- Organizes services by category matching the project structure
- Includes the custom exist network configuration

Key Features:

- Profile-based deployment: Services can be deployed individually, by category, or all
  together
- Consistent configuration: Shared logging, timezone, and NAS settings across all services
- Proper dependencies: Services wait for their databases/dependencies to be healthy
- Volume management: Mix of local and NFS volumes based on data persistence needs
- Security: No hardcoded passwords, all sensitive data comes from environment variables

Usage:

# Deploy specific services

docker compose --profile librechat --profile windmill up -d

# Deploy by category

docker compose --profile ai --profile automation up -d

# Deploy everything

docker compose --profile all up -d
